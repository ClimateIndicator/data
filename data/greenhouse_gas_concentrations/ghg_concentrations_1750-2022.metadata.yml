# Description and more...
data_description: Greenhouse gas concentrations for 52 species. Values are global annual mean volume mixing ratios. CO2 is in parts per million volume (ppm). CH4 and N2O are in parts per billion volume (ppb = 10 to the power of -9). All other gases are in parts per trillion volume (ppt = 10 to the power of -12).
